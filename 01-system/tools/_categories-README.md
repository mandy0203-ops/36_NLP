# Tool Categories

Organize tools by category folders:
- `llms/`: Large Language Model wrappers.
- `ops/`: Operational tools (file system, git, etc.).
- `stt/`: Speech-to-Text tools.
- `vision/`: Computer Vision tools.
- `web/`: Web scraping and interaction tools.

Each tool should have its own directory within a category, containing the implementation and a `README.md`.
